# kohya_ss_setting_ti

Kohya setting for embedding with sdxl.

These are the setting I use. Not saying they are the best. Just pieces I put together from here and there. 

Load the json file and change the setting that you need to. I use linux, not sure if windows setup is different. 

Also very helpful to watch the videos on Kohya_ss github page.
